### Overview

This project provides a data exploration and visualisation of data on Penguins using R Studio.

The first script analyses how bill length differ between the three species of penguin. 

The second showcases a correlation matrix between bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass across species.

### Dataset

The dataset used is the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package.
Includes measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.

The dataset consists of 7 columns and 344 rows.

- species - a factor denoting penguin species (Ad√©lie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)
- island - a factor denoting island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Biscoe, Dream or Torgersen)
- bill_length_mm - a number denoting bill length (millimeters)
- bill_depth_mm - a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)
- flipper_length_mm - an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)
- body_mass_g - an integer denoting body mass (grams)
- sex - a factor denoting penguin sex (female, male)
- year- an integer denoting the study year (2007, 2008, or 2009)

Of the 7 columns, 3 are categorical (species, island, sex) and the rest are numeric.

### Process Methodology

The purpose of this project was to look closer at the size measurements for adult foraging penguins and to analyse these using exploratory analysis, statistics, hypothesis testing and correlation matrix. 

### Packages Used

The dataset was dowloaded from `palmerpenguins` package. The main package used for exploratory analysis and visualisation was `tidyverse`.
The packages used for statistics, hypothesis testing and correlation matrix were `e107`, `infer`, `GGally` respectively.

### Findings

#### Hypothesis Testing

I performed a suitable hypothesis test to check whether the mean bill length of Gentoo is significantly longer than the mean bill length of Adelie.
I concluded that I have found enough evidence in my data to suggest that the mean bill length of Gentoo is significantly longer than the mean bill length of Adelie.

#### Correlation Matrix
Across penguin species, there is a strong positive correlation between body mass and flipper length. 
There is a strong positive correlation between body mass and bill length. 
And also a strong positive correlation between flipper length and bill length.
Surprisingly, there is no correlation between body mass and bill depth or between bill length and bill depth.
Based on this, we can assume that heavier/larger penguins have longer bills and flippers.
